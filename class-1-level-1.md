# Class 1 (Week 2) - Level 1: Smart Usage
**Total: 75 minutes | Instruction: 45 min | Practice: 30 min**

---

## **Instruction Block (45 min)**

### **[0-3 min] Homework Debrief**
- Quick share: "Best thing you discovered this week?" (3-4 rapid responses)
- Transition: "Now let's get smarter about HOW you use AI"

### **[3-13 min] Survey of AI Providers**

**ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

- Best for: General tasks, creative writing, conversation
- Free tier + $20/mo (Plus)
- o1 model with thinking/reasoning mode

**Claude (Anthropic)**
- Longer context, good with documents
- Best for: Analysis, complex research, coding
- Free tier + $20/mo (Pro)
- Extended thinking mode available
- Most privacy-focused

**Gemini (Google)**

### **[13-18 min] The $20 Question**

**What You Get with Paid:**
- Faster responses
- Access during peak times (no "at capacity" errors)
- Better models (GPT-4, Claude Opus, etc.)
- Higher usage limits
- Extra features (image generation, longer conversations, priority access)

**Live Comparison:**

- Quality test: Complex task on both
- Show usage limits

**Decision Framework:**
- Using daily? → Probably worth it
- Mission-critical work? → Worth it
- Just experimenting? → Free is fine
- Try free for a week, then decide

### **[18-30 min] Data Privacy & Legal Reality**

#### **How Providers Use Your Data (5 min)**

**ChatGPT:**
- Consumer (Free/Plus): Used for training BY DEFAULT
- Must actively opt out: Settings → Data Controls
- Business accounts: NOT used for training
- Retention: 30 days minimum

**Claude:**
- 2025 policy change: Opt-in model
- Opt out (default): 30-day retention
- Opt in: Up to 5 years retention
- Commercial plans: NOT used for training
- Never sold to third parties

**Gemini:**
- Tied to Google account
- Used to improve Google services
- Subject to Google's data policies

**Perplexity:**
- Stores search history
- Uses data to improve service

#### **Legal Compliance Issues (10 min)**

**HIPAA (Healthcare):**
- ❌ Consumer AI chatbots are NOT HIPAA compliant
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini will NOT sign Business Associate Agreements (BAA)
- Using AI with patient health information = HIPAA violation
- Penalties: $100-$50,000 per violation
- ✅ Can use for: General medical questions, anonymous symptoms
- ❌ Cannot use for: Patient records, identifying information

**Attorney-Client Privilege:**
- Using public AI likely WAIVES privilege
- Sharing with third-party = no longer confidential
- No "chatbot-user privilege" exists
- Risk: Opposing counsel could subpoena AI provider
- ✅ Can use for: Generic legal research, templates
- ❌ Cannot use for: Client case details, strategies

**Other Professions:**
- Teachers: FERPA protects student records
- Accountants: IRS confidentiality requirements
- Financial advisors: SEC regulations
- Business: Trade secret exposure risk

**Who Owns What:**
- You own your input (but grant license to provider)
- You generally own the output
- AI output often not copyrightable (no human author)
- Limited liability if there's a breach

#### **The Red/Yellow/Green Framework (3 min)**

**🔴 Red Light - NEVER Share:**
- Social Security Numbers, passwords, API keys
- Bank account/credit card numbers
- Full tax returns with SSN
- Medical records with your name
- Protected Health Information (if healthcare worker)
- Client privileged info (if lawyer)
- Student records (if teacher)
- Trade secrets, proprietary business info
- Other people's private information

**🟡 Yellow Light - Anonymize First:**
- Medical questions → Remove all identifiers
- Legal scenarios → Make hypothetical
- Financial advice → Use approximate numbers
- Work problems → Change names, companies

**🟢 Green Light - Generally Safe:**
- Personal productivity
- Public information research
- Creative projects
- General knowledge questions
- Coding help (generic code)
- Meal planning, travel, hobbies

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Would you post it on social media? If no → don't share with AI
- Can it identify you? → Remove names, dates, specific numbers
- Is it someone else's private info? → Don't share it

### **[30-38 min] Prompting 101**

#### **What is a Prompt?**
Simple: "Your question or instruction to AI"

#### **Memory/Context Explained:**
- AI remembers your conversation (like texting a friend)
- Can reference earlier messages
- Limits: Very long conversations, AI may forget the beginning
- Tip: Start new chat when switching topics

#### **Practical Features:**

**Adding Documents:**
- Upload PDF, AI reads and answers questions
- Live demo: Upload document, ask about it
- Use cases: Contracts, articles, reports, manuals

**Researching:**
- "Compare these 5 options for me"
- "Summarize this topic"
- "What are pros and cons of X?"

**Explaining Complex Things:**
- "Explain this legal term like I'm 10 years old"
- "What does this medical diagnosis mean?"
- "Break down this technical concept"

#### **How to Write Good Prompts:**

**The Meta Move:** Ask AI to help you write prompts!
- Bad prompt: "Tell me about marketing"
- Ask AI: "How can I make this prompt better?"
- Use AI's suggestions
- See the improved results

**4 Quick Rules:**
1. **Be specific**: Not "plan a trip" → "Plan a 3-day trip to Austin under $1000"
2. **Give context**: "I'm a teacher planning..." / "I'm training for a marathon..."
3. **Set format**: "Give me a bullet list" / "Make a table" / "Number the steps"
4. **Assign a role**: "You're an expert lawyer" / "You're a fitness coach" / "You're a patient tutor"

### **[38-43 min] Thinking Mode vs Regular Mode**

**What is Thinking Mode?**
- AI shows its work before answering
- Like watching someone solve a math problem step-by-step
- Takes longer, but more thorough
- Available in ChatGPT (o1) and Claude (Extended Thinking)

**When to Use Thinking Mode:**
- Complex problems with multiple steps
- Math/logic puzzles
- Strategic planning
- When regular mode gives wrong answers
- Investment/financial decisions
- Multi-step planning

**When Regular Mode is Fine:**
- Quick questions
- Creative writing
- Simple research
- Brainstorming
- Casual conversation
- Most everyday tasks

**Live Demo:**
- Same complex question in both modes
- Compare: Speed vs thoroughness
- Example: "I have $10k to invest, I'm 35, moderate risk tolerance - what's a smart allocation?"

### **[43-45 min] ⚠️ Hallucinations & What AI is Bad At**

**Critical Warning: AI Makes Stuff Up**
- AI will confidently state false information
- Invents sources, statistics, facts
- Looks completely convincing
- Gets better at creative content than facts

**Live Demo:**
- Ask AI something obscure that might trigger hallucination
- Show how confident it sounds even when wrong
- "Did this source actually exist? Let's check..."

**Red Flags:**
- Suspiciously specific statistics
- Convenient facts that support the argument
- "Studies show..." without clear source
- Citations that look real but aren't

**What AI is BAD At:**
- Complex math (getting better, but verify)
- Counting things accurately
- Current events (check training cutoff dates)
- Precise logic sometimes
- Remembering things from 50 messages ago

**When NOT to Use AI:**
- Legal/medical decisions → Get a professional
- Financial calculations → Verify yourself
- Anything where being wrong has serious consequences
- Critical fact-checking → Use multiple sources

**How to Verify:**
- Cross-check important information
- Use Perplexity for sourced answers
- Ask AI for citations, then verify them
- Google the "facts" AI gives you
- Trust but verify
