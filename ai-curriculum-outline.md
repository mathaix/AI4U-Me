## Course Structure

### **Week 1: AI Basics + Smart Usage** (Levels 0-1)
**Goal:** Get comfortable using AI and use it safely

**In Class (2-3 hours):**
- Hands-on: Everyone creates accounts (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Live demo: Bad prompts vs good prompts
- Try it together: Plan a trip, research something, write an email
- Safety discussion: What NEVER to share
- Provider comparison: Try 2-3 different AIs side-by-side

**Homework:**
- Use AI every day for a week (minimum 1 task/day)
- Journal: What worked? What didn't?
- Decide: Will you pay $20/mo? Why or why not?

**Milestone:** Come to Week 2 with 7 examples of things you tried

---

### **Week 2: Finding Your Use Cases** (Level 2)
**Goal:** Spot opportunities for AI in YOUR life/work

**In Class:**
- Students share their Week 1 experiments
- Show 15-20 real-world examples across domains
- Breakout activity: Identify 3 ways AI could help YOUR work/life
- Guest speaker or case study

**Homework:**
- Implement your 3 use cases for real
- Find one "weird" use case online and try it
- Bring a problem AI couldn't solve (learn the limits)

**Milestone:** AI solves at least one recurring problem for you

---

### **Week 3: Automation** (Level 3)
**Goal:** Make AI work automatically

**In Class:**
- Tools demo: Zapier, Make.com, or similar
- Set up together: Simple workflow
- Keyboard shortcuts and browser extensions
- Templates and saved prompts
- ChatGPT custom GPTs or Claude Projects

**Homework:**
- Build 2 automated workflows
- Create 3-5 prompt templates
- Set up one "push-button" AI task

**Milestone:** Something happens automatically without manual prompting

---

### **Week 4: Build Something** (Level 4)
**Goal:** Create tools by talking to AI

**In Class:**
- Intro to vibe coding
- Tool demo: Cursor, Claude Code, or Replit
- Live build: Make a simple tool together
- Iterate: Fix it with AI
- Publishing basics

**Homework/Final Project:**
