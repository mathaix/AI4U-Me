![AI Enlightenment Framework](ai-enlightenment-framework.png)

## 4-Week AI Fluency Program (5 Levels of AI Enlightenment)

**Format:** 5 sessions over 4 weeks (Class 0–4) • 75–90 minutes each<br>
**Audience:** Non-technical or mixed teams who want practical AI skills fast<br>
**Approach:** "Learn to drive, not build the car" — hands-on, safety-first, outcome-driven<br>
**Promise:** In 4 weeks, participants go from "What is this?" to "I built something."

## Philosophy: "Learn to Drive, Not Build the Car"

This curriculum focuses on **practical skills over theory**. You don't need to understand how AI works internally to use it effectively—just like you don't need to understand engine mechanics to drive a car.

### Core Principles

1. **AI is for everyone** — Engineers, doctors, plumbers, students, parents, teachers, retirees
2. **Safety first** — Clear guardrails on what never to share
3. **Hands-on learning** — Work on real tasks, not hypotheticals
4. **Progressive mastery** — Each level builds on the previous
5. **Tool-agnostic** — Learn principles that work across all AI platforms
6. **Build to ship** — End with something real you or others can use

---

## Program Outcomes

By the end of this program, participants will be able to:

- ✅ Confidently use AI for everyday work and life tasks with safety guardrails
- ✅ Write clear, iterative prompts that improve results across tools
- ✅ Choose the right AI tool for a job and understand tradeoffs/risks
- ✅ Design simple automations that save time
- ✅ Ship a small AI-built project from their own description

## The 5 Levels Journey

### 📘 [Class 0: Level 0 — Understanding](class-0-level-0.md)
**Week 1 • The Foundation**

- Who AI is for (poll + belief: AI is for everyone)
- What AI can/can't do today
- Safety basics (what never to share)
- Free vs paid side-by-side comparison
- Live demo: research, planning, organizing info
- Guided first prompts and open practice

**Outcome:** Holds a basic, safe AI conversation on a real task

### 📗 [Class 1: Level 1 — Smart Usage](class-1-level-1.md)
**Week 2 • Mastering Prompts**

- Context windows, specificity, iteration
- Prompt examples and live/interacting demo
- Survey of AI providers (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- Privacy/legal compliance (HIPAA, attorney-client privilege, FERPA)
- Thinking mode vs regular mode
- **Critical:** How AI hallucinates & fact-checking
- Practice with real scenarios using a simple prompt rubric

**Outcome:** Writes clear prompts with context and reliably improves answers

### 📙 Class 2: Level 2 — AI Ecosystem
**Week 3 • Choosing the Right Tool**

*Coming soon*

- Which tool when: NotebookLM, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude CLI, Perplexity
- Risks and limitations: data use, bias, provider differences
- Free vs paid tradeoffs in depth

**Outcome:** Picks the right AI tool and understands tradeoffs and risks

---

### 📕 Class 3: Level 3 — AI as Personal Assistant
**Week 4 • Automation & Workflows**

*Coming soon*

- Examples of AI-powered life and work automations
- Introduction to MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Build a simple AI-assisted workflow
- Troubleshoot and refine automations

**Outcome:** Designs and runs simple AI-assisted workflows that save time

---

### 📓 Class 4: Level 4 — Build Stuff
**Week 5 • Ship Something Real**

*Coming soon*

- "Vibe coding" with no/low code: you describe, AI builds
- Plan → generate → test a small project
- Build a document, script, or mini app
- Present your creation

**Outcome:** Ships a small AI-built project from their own description

---

## Why This Matters

**Right now, a gap is forming:**

People who use AI effectively vs. people who don't use AI at all.

**The gap is growing every day.**

This course puts you on the right side of that gap. In 4 weeks, you'll go from "What is this?" to "I built something."
