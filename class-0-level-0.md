# Class 0 (Week 1) - Level 0: AI Basics
**Total: 75 minutes | Instruction: 45 min | Practice: 30 min**

---

## **Course Philosophy**
"Learn to drive, not build the car" - Practical skills, not theory. Focus on what AI can DO for you.

---

## **Instruction Block (45 min)**

### **[0-5 min] Opening: Who is AI For?**

**Interactive Poll:**
"Raise your hand if you think AI is useful for..."
- Engineers? ✋
- Doctors? ✋
- Plumbers? ✋
- Students? ✋
- Stay-at-home parents? ✋
- Small business owners? ✋
- Teachers? ✋
- Retirees? ✋

**Observe:**
- Watch how responses vary
- Notice: Some groups get more hands than others
- Ask: "Why did fewer hands go up for [group]?"

**Then: Ask ChatGPT Live**
- Project on screen
- Type: "Who is AI useful for? Is it mainly for technical professionals or can regular people use it?"
- Read response together
- Point out: Even AI says it's for everyone

**The Hook (Your Belief):**
> "Here's what I believe: **Everyone can and should take advantage of AI.** But here's the catch—you can't just jump in randomly. You need a structured path. That's what this course is."

### **[5-12 min] The 5 Levels of AI Enlightenment**

**Present the Framework Visually:**

**Level 0: Basic Conversations**
- Where most people are now
- "I've heard of ChatGPT, maybe tried it once"
- Learning: How to talk to AI and get useful answers

**Level 1: Smart Usage** *(Class 1 - Next Week)*
- Know how to get GOOD results
- Use AI safely and choose the right tools
- Understand what to share and what not to share

**Level 2: Spot Opportunities** *(Class 2 - Week 3)*
- See where AI fits in YOUR life
- Not generic examples, but YOUR specific needs
- AI becomes part of your routine

**Level 3: Automation** *(Class 3 - Week 4)*
- Make AI work for you automatically
- Set it up once, it runs on its own
- AI does things without you asking every time

**Level 4: Build Stuff** *(Class 4 - Week 5)*
- Create actual tools by talking to AI
- No coding experience needed
- You describe, AI builds

**The Journey:**
- "In 4 weeks, you'll go from 'What is this?' to 'I built something.'"
- "That's the path we're taking together"
- "Today we start at Level 0. By the end of class, you'll be at Level 1."

### **[12-35 min] Live Demo: AI as Research Partner**

**Setup the Meta:**
- "I'm going to show you how I'm using AI RIGHT NOW to build this course"
- "This is exactly what you'll be able to do—use AI to research, plan, and solve real problems"
- "Watch how I work with it"

**Live Session - Screenshare Your Actual AI Conversation:**

**1. Show the Conversation (3 min)**
- Pull up your actual Claude/ChatGPT conversation about building this curriculum
- Scroll through a few exchanges
- Point out: "See? I'm having a conversation, not just asking one question"

**2. Demonstrate Research (7 min)**
- Pick a topic: "Let's say I need to understand what automation tools are available"
- Ask AI live: "What are the easiest automation tools for non-technical people to connect AI to their daily apps? I need something with a good free tier."
- Read the response together
- Discuss: Is this helpful? What else do we need to know?
- Follow-up question: "Which of these has the best free tier and why?"
- Show: The answer gets more specific

**3. Show Iteration (5 min)**
- "Notice: AI didn't give me exactly what I wanted the first time. That's normal."
- "So I ask again, but differently"
- Demo: Refine a prompt when results aren't perfect
- Bad answer → Better question → Better answer
- "This is a conversation. You're in control. Keep asking until you get what you need."

**4. Show Practical Organization (5 min)**
- "Now I need to organize this information"
- Ask AI: "Create a comparison table of these automation tools with columns for: ease of use, free tier limits, and best use case"
- Boom—instant table appears
- "See? It can format information however you need"

**5. The Power Move - AI as Thought Partner (5 min)**
- "I can even ask it to critique my ideas"
- Show: "Here's my curriculum outline for teaching AI to regular people. What am I missing? What would make this better?"
- Read AI's suggestions
- "See? It's like having a smart colleague available 24/7"
- "You can do this for YOUR projects, YOUR work, YOUR problems"

**Debrief (5 min):**
- "What did you notice about how I used AI?"
- Get student observations
- Highlight key patterns:
  - ✅ I was specific in my questions
  - ✅ I iterated and refined
  - ✅ I treated it like a conversation
  - ✅ I stayed in control (I decide what advice to use)
  - ✅ I used it to organize and format information
  - ✅ I asked it to challenge my thinking

**Key Takeaway:**
"AI isn't magic. It's a tool. A really powerful tool. But YOU are the one driving."

### **[35-45 min] Safety & Smart Choices**

#### **What NEVER to Share (5 min)**

**Interactive Discussion:**
"What do you think you should NEVER share with AI?"
- Let students call out answers
- Build the list together

**The Never Share List:**
- Passwords or API keys
- Social Security Number
- Bank account numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Private medical records (with your name)
- Other people's confidential information
- Company trade secrets (unless you have permission)

**Why Not?**
- Data could be stored
- Some conversations reviewed by humans
- Data breaches happen
- Could be used for training (= might resurface)
- You don't control who sees it later

**Rule of Thumb:**
"If you wouldn't post it on Facebook, don't share it with AI"

#### **The $20 Question (5 min)**

**Free vs Paid Side-by-Side:**
- Show: Same prompt on free ChatGPT vs Plus
- Compare:
  - Speed
  - Quality of response
  - Features available

**Quick intro to other AIs:**
- "ChatGPT isn't the only one"
- Mention: Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- "They're like different brands of cars—all get you there, slightly different feel"
- "Try a couple this week, see what you like"

**The Decision:**
"You'll decide this week if $20/month is worth it for YOU"
- Using it daily? Probably worth it
- Just trying it out? Free is fine for now
- You can always upgrade later

- Getting meal ideas for the week
- Writing a difficult email
- Planning a project or event

**Guided First Prompt (5 min):**
- Everyone tries the same topic together
- Instructor: "Let's all ask about planning a weekend trip"
- Type it together, see results
- Notice: Everyone gets slightly different answers
- "Now make your question more specific and try again"

**Open Practice (10 min):**
- Students work on their own real tasks
- Try different prompts
- Iterate if needed
- Instructor circulates:
  - Answer questions
  - Help with stuck moments
  - Suggest prompt improvements
  - Celebrate good results
  - Troubleshoot tech issues

**What to Notice:**
- How does AI respond to vague vs specific questions?
- What happens when you ask follow-up questions?
- Can you have a back-and-forth conversation?
- What's useful? What's not?

### **[60-70 min] Share Out & Discussion**

**Volunteers Share (7 min):**
- 3-4 students show their screens
- "What did you research?"
- "What did AI tell you?"
- "Was it helpful?"
- "What would you ask differently next time?"

**Class Discussion (3 min):**
- What worked well?
- What was frustrating?
- What surprised you?
- What questions do you have?

### **[70-75 min] Wrap-Up & Homework**

**Recap:**
- "You just used AI for the first time (or better than before)"
- "You saw how I use it to research and plan"
- "You tried it yourself on a real task"
- "That's Level 0 → Level 1"

**Homework Assignment:**

**Required:**
1. **Use AI every single day this week** (minimum once per day)
2. **Try at least 3 different types of tasks** (research, writing, planning, learning, etc.)
3. **Keep notes**: What worked? What didn't? What surprised you?
4. **Make a decision**: Will you pay for a subscription? Why or why not?
5. **Try at least 2 different AIs** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)

**Come to Class 1 ready to share:**
- Your best example from the week
- One thing that didn't work well
- Which AI you liked best (so far)

**Resources Provided:**
- Account creation links (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- Safety checklist (what never to share)
- "50 things to try with AI" starter list
- Homework tracking sheet

**Final Thought:**
"Right now, there's a growing gap between people who use AI and people who don't. You're on the right side of that gap now. By next week, you'll be even further ahead."

**Q&A:**
- Any questions before next week?

## **Common Issues & Solutions**

**"I can't create an account"**
- Solution: Help with email verification, try different email provider, check spam folder

**"It says ChatGPT is at capacity"**
- Solution: This is why we teach multiple AIs, switch to Claude or try later

**"I don't know what to ask"**
- Solution: Point to the "50 things to try" list, suggest starting with something they actually need

**"The answer doesn't make sense"**
- Solution: Ask a follow-up question, rephrase, try being more specific

**"Is this answer true?"**
- Solution: Great question! We'll cover fact-checking next week. For now, verify important info elsewhere.

**"This feels overwhelming"**
- Solution: Start simple. Just ask it one question about something you're curious about. You don't have to master it today.
