## **Instruction Block (45 min)**

### **[0-5 min] Opening: Who is AI For?**

**Interactive Poll:**
"Raise your hand if you think AI is useful for..."
- Engineers? ✋
- Doctors? ✋
- Plumbers? ✋
- Students? ✋
- Stay-at-home parents? ✋
- Small business owners? ✋
- Teachers? ✋
- Retirees? ✋

**Observe:**
- Watch how responses vary
- Notice: Some groups get more hands than others
- Ask: "Why did fewer hands go up for [group]?"

**Then: Ask ChatGPT Live**
- Project on screen
- Type: "Who is AI useful for? Is it mainly for technical professionals or can regular people use it?"
- Read response together
- Point out: Even AI says it's for everyone

**The Hook (Your Belief):**
> "Here's what I believe: **Everyone can and should take advantage of AI.** But here's the catch—you can't just jump in randomly. You need a structured path. That's what this course is."

### **[5-12 min] The 5 Levels of AI Enlightenment**

**Present the Framework Visually:**

| Level | Class | What You'll Learn | Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Level 0: Understanding** | *This class* | • Different levels of AI enlightenment<br>• Using AI for learning, research, planning, brainstorming and self-introspection | You know what AI can (and cannot) do for you today and can hold a basic, safe AI conversation |
| **Level 1: Smart Usage** | *Class 1 - Next Week* | • Theory: Context and context window<br>• Prompt examples<br>• Live demo of advanced prompting | You can write clear prompts with context, iterate, and improve answers reliably |
| **Level 2: AI Ecosystem** | *Class 2 - Week 3* | • Different consumer AI tools/models<br>• When to use what (NotebookLLM, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude CLI)<br>• AI Risks: data usage, tool risks, limitations and bias | You can pick the right AI tool for a task and understand tradeoffs, limitations, and risks |
| **Level 3: AI as Personal Assistant** | *Class 3 - Week 4* | • Examples of AI automation in daily life<br>• Introduction to MCP<br>• Creating your own automation | You can design and run simple AI-assisted workflows that save you time |
| **Level 4: Build Stuff** | *Class 4 - Week 5* | • "Vibe coding" - no coding experience needed<br>• You describe, AI builds | You can ship a small AI-built project (no-code or low-code) from your own description |

**The Journey:**
- "In 4 weeks, you'll go from 'What is this?' to 'I built something.'"
- "That's the path we're taking together"
- "Today we start at Level 0. By the end of class, you'll be at Level 1."


### Class Requirements
- laptop for studens
- projector for instructor
- internet connection

### Class 0 - content. 
### **[12-35 min] Live Demo: AI as Research Partner**

**Setup the Meta:**
- "I'm going to show you how I'm using AI RIGHT NOW to build this course"
- "This is exactly what you'll be able to do—use AI to research, plan, and solve real problems"
- "Watch how I work with it"

**Live Session - Screenshare Your Actual AI Conversation:**

**1. Show the Conversation (3 min)**
- Pull up your actual Claude/ChatGPT conversation about building this curriculum
- Scroll through a few exchanges
- Point out: "See? I'm having a conversation, not just asking one question"

**2. Demonstrate Research (7 min)**
- Pick a topic: "Let's say I need to understand what automation tools are available"
- Ask AI live: "What are the easiest automation tools for non-technical people to connect AI to their daily apps? I need something with a good free tier."
- Read the response together
- Discuss: Is this helpful? What else do we need to know?
- Follow-up question: "Which of these has the best free tier and why?"
- Show: The answer gets more specific

**3. Show Iteration (5 min)**
- "Notice: AI didn't give me exactly what I wanted the first time. That's normal."
- "So I ask again, but differently"
- Demo: Refine a prompt when results aren't perfect
- Bad answer → Better question → Better answer
- "This is a conversation. You're in control. Keep asking until you get what you need."

**4. Show Practical Organization (5 min)**
- "Now I need to organize this information"
- Ask AI: "Create a comparison table of these automation tools with columns for: ease of use, free tier limits, and best use case"
- Boom—instant table appears
- "See? It can format information however you need"

**5. The Power Move - AI as Thought Partner (5 min)**
- "I can even ask it to critique my ideas"
- Show: "Here's my curriculum outline for teaching AI to regular people. What am I missing? What would make this better?"
- Read AI's suggestions
- "See? It's like having a smart colleague available 24/7"
- "You can do this for YOUR projects, YOUR work, YOUR problems"
