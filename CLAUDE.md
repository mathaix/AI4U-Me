# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a curriculum repository for teaching AI literacy to non-technical audiences. The "5 Levels of AI Enlightenment" program takes learners from basic AI understanding to building their own projects in 4 weeks.

**Core Philosophy:** "Learn to drive, not build the car" — practical skills over theory, with safety-first principles and immediate real-world application.

## Content Architecture

### The 5 Levels Framework

All materials are structured around this progression:

1. **Level 0: Understanding** (Class 0) → Know what AI can/cannot do; hold safe conversations
2. **Level 1: Smart Usage** (Class 1) → Write clear prompts with context; iterate reliably
3. **Level 2: AI Ecosystem** (Class 2) → Pick right tool for task; understand tradeoffs/risks
4. **Level 3: Personal Assistant** (Class 3) → Design simple AI workflows; basic automation
5. **Level 4: Build Stuff** (Class 4) → "Vibe coding" to ship a small project

### Key Pedagogical Patterns

**Safety-First Approach:**
- Red/Yellow/Green framework for data sharing
- Never share: SSN, passwords, medical records with names, client privileged info
- Rule of thumb: "If you wouldn't post it on social media, don't share with AI"
- Legal compliance warnings (HIPAA, attorney-client privilege, FERPA)

**Live Demo Pattern:**
- Instructor demonstrates real AI usage (not scripted)
- Shows iteration: Bad answer → Better question → Better answer
- Meta approach: Using AI to build the curriculum itself
- Emphasizes conversation over single-shot queries

**Practice Block Structure:**
- Every class: 45 min instruction + 30 min hands-on
- Students work on REAL tasks (not hypotheticals)
- Share-outs highlight patterns and teachable moments

## Editing Guidelines

### When Updating Course Materials

1. **Maintain Timing Discipline:** Class sessions are 75 minutes with strict blocks
   - Adjust segment times if adding content
   - Update timing checkpoints in instructor notes

2. **Preserve Safety Warnings:** Never remove or dilute privacy/legal sections
   - HIPAA, attorney-client privilege, and FERPA warnings are critical
   - Red/Yellow/Green framework must stay consistent

3. **Keep Progressive Structure:** Each level builds on previous
   - Don't introduce advanced concepts in early classes
   - Homework from each class feeds into next session

4. **Use Consistent Examples:**
   - Examples should be non-technical and broadly relatable
   - Avoid jargon or assume prior tech knowledge
   - Prefer real-world tasks: meal planning, email writing, trip planning

### Style & Tone

- **Accessible:** Written for complete beginners
- **Practical:** Every concept ties to immediate use case
- **Non-intimidating:** "You can't break it" messaging throughout
- **Safety-conscious:** Warnings presented clearly without fear-mongering

### Version Control

When AI capabilities change:
- Update provider comparison matrix in curriculum-resources.md
- Check pricing accuracy (currently $20/mo standard for paid tiers)
- Review feature availability (image gen, voice, thinking mode, etc.)
- Add version note: "Last Updated: [date]"

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Class/Level

1. Create new file: `class-X-level-X.md`
2. Follow structure: Philosophy → Instruction Block (45min) → Practice Block (30min) → Homework
3. Include timing markers: `[X-Y min] Section Title`
4. Add to ai4u-4-week-proposal.md weekly arc
5. Update slide deck if needed

### Updating AI Provider Information

1. Primary source: curriculum-resources.md
2. Update: Capabilities matrix, pricing table, privacy policies
3. Cross-check: class-1-level-1.md provider survey section
4. Verify links still work

### Adding Prompt Examples

- Add to class-1-level-1.md "50 Prompts to Try" list
- Organize by category: Productivity, Learning, Creative, Research, Problem-Solving
- Use specific, actionable examples: "Create a weekly meal plan for a family of 4, budget $200"
- Avoid: Generic prompts like "Help me with marketing"

## Target Audience Considerations

**Learner Profile:**
- No technical background assumed
- May have AI anxiety or skepticism
- Needs immediate practical value to stay engaged
- Concerned about privacy and job displacement

**Instructor Profile:**
- Needs clear timing guidance
- Benefits from backup slides/examples
- Looks for common student concerns and responses
- Values detailed notes on what to watch for during practice

## Key Course Differentiators

1. **Structured Path:** Not random exploration; clear level progression
2. **Safety Integration:** Privacy taught alongside features, not as afterthought
3. **Real Practice:** Students must bring real tasks, not practice on toy examples
4. **Multiple Tools:** Teaches provider-agnostic skills; compare ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Perplexity
5. **Build to Ship:** Ends with students creating actual projects

## Materials Not to Remove

- Privacy checklists and Red/Yellow/Green framework
- "50 Prompts to Try" list (students rely on this)
- Fact-checking exercise (critical for hallucination awareness)
- Provider comparison matrix
- Timing checkpoints in lesson plans
