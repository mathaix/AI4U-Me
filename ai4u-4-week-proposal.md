# 4-Week AI Fluency Program (5 Levels of AI Enlightenment)
**Format:** 5 sessions over 4 weeks (Class 0–4) • 75–90 minutes each  
**Audience:** Non-technical or mixed teams who want practical AI skills fast  
**Approach:** “Learn to drive, not build the car” — hands-on, safety-first, outcome-driven  
**Promise:** In 4 weeks, participants go from “What is this?” to “I built something.”

## Program Outcomes
- Confidently use AI for everyday work and life tasks with safety guardrails
- Write clear, iterative prompts that improve results across tools
- Choose the right AI tool for a job and understand tradeoffs/risks
- Design simple automations that save time; ship a small AI-built project by the end

## Weekly Arc
**Class 0: Level 0 — Understanding**  
- Who AI is for (poll + belief: AI is for everyone); what AI can/can’t do today  
- Safety basics (what never to share); free vs paid side-by-side  
- Live demo: research, planning, organizing info; guided first prompts and open practice  
- Outcome: Holds a basic, safe AI conversation on a real task

**Class 1: Level 1 — Smart Usage**  
- Context windows, specificity, iteration; prompt examples and live/interacting demo  
- Practice with real scenarios using a simple prompt rubric  
- Outcome: Writes clear prompts with context and reliably improves answers

**Class 2: Level 2 — AI Ecosystem**  
- Which tool when: NotebookLM, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity  
- Risks and limitations: data use, bias, provider differences; free vs paid tradeoffs  
- Outcome: Picks the right AI tool and understands tradeoffs and risks

**Class 3: Level 3 — AI as Personal Assistant**  
- Examples of AI-powered life and work automations; intro to MCP  
- Build a simple AI-assisted workflow; troubleshoot and refine  
- Outcome: Designs and runs simple AI-assisted workflows that save time

**Class 4: Level 4 — Build Stuff**  
- “Vibe coding” with no/low code: you describe, AI builds  
- Plan → generate → test a small project (document, script, or mini app)  
- Outcome: Ships a small AI-built project from their own description

## Delivery Notes
- Materials: visual “5 Levels of AI Enlightenment,” safety checklist, quickstart prompts, “50 things to try,” homework tracker
- Modality: In-person or virtual; projector/screenshare and reliable internet required
- Homework: Daily AI use, try multiple tools, note surprises, decide on free vs paid by Week 2
- Support: Instructor circulates during labs; backup prompts/examples if live demos stall
