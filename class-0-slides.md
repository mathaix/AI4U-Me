**Key point: It's a conversation, not a single question**

---

# Slide 12: What You'll Notice

## During the Demo

Watch for these patterns:

1. **Specific questions** → Better answers
2. **Iteration** → First answer isn't always perfect
3. **Conversation** → Back and forth, building on previous
4. **Control** → I decide what to use
5. **Formatting** → Ask AI to organize (tables, lists, etc.)
6. **Critique** → Ask AI to challenge my thinking

---

# Slide 13: Safety First

## 🔴 What NEVER to Share

**Call out answers - what should you NEVER share?**

- Passwords
- Social Security Number
- Bank account numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Medical records (with your name)
- Other people's private info
- Company secrets

**Rule of thumb:**
If you wouldn't post it on Facebook → Don't share with AI

# Slide 14: Why Not?

## The Risks

- ⚠️ Data could be stored

**Be smart. Protect yourself.**
