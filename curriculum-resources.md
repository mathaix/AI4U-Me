## **Common AI Limitations**

### **What AI is NOT Good At (Yet):**

❌ **Perfect Math** - Can make calculation errors (verify important math)
❌ **Counting** - Often miscounts words, characters, items in lists
❌ **Current Events** - Training data has cutoff dates (unless it has web search)
❌ **Remembering Long Conversations** - May forget details from 50+ messages ago
❌ **Being Original** - Combines existing patterns, doesn't truly create new ideas
❌ **Understanding Context Perfectly** - Can misinterpret nuance
❌ **Avoiding All Hallucinations** - Will sometimes make up facts confidently
❌ **Replacing Professionals** - Not a substitute for doctors, lawyers, accountants

### **Red Flags for Hallucinations:**

🚩 Suspiciously specific statistics without sources
🚩 Citations that sound real but you can't find
🚩 "Studies show..." without naming the study
🚩 Historical "facts" that seem too convenient
🚩 Exact numbers when asked for approximations
🚩 Perfect answers to very niche questions

**Always verify important information!**
